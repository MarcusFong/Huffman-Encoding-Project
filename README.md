# Huffman-Encoding-Project
During quarantine last year, I stumbled across a video from Tom Scott (https://youtu.be/JsTptu56GM8) about Huffman encodings.
I found the topic to be very interesting, so I decided to make my own version of it.

Creates a Huffman encoding given a text file and some String input. The text file is used to construct the Huffman Tree and any
inputted String will be returned in its encoded form. The program will also ask the user to input their own encoding to be 
decoded.

Run HuffmanTester.java with a .txt file with words as a command line argument to test out the Huffman encoding.
